## The Challenge

Jabil, a global manufacturing solutions provider, faced challenges with managing employee access to a wide range of applications. Multiple login credentials and complex access processes hindered productivity and user experience. 

## The Solution

We implemented a centralized Okta Single Sign-On (SSO) solution, providing Jabil employees with a single dashboard to access all their essential applications. 

* **Unified Access:** The Okta dashboard became the central hub for Jabil employees, offering quick and easy access to applications, resources, and tools.
* **Enhanced Security:** Okta's robust security features, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), strengthened Jabil's security posture by protecting sensitive data and applications.
* **Increased Productivity:**  SSO eliminated the need for employees to remember multiple passwords, reducing password reset requests and improving productivity.
* **Seamless User Experience:** The intuitive Okta dashboard provided a consistent and user-friendly experience, simplifying access for employees across various locations and departments.

## Jabil: On the Cutting Edge

Jabil's commitment to innovation extended beyond adopting Okta. Their technical team actively contributed to the Okta community by:

* **Providing Updated Samples and Documentation:** Jabil's insights and real-world experience helped improve Okta's documentation and provided valuable resources for other Okta users.
* **Collaborating with Okta:** Jabil worked closely with Okta's development team, providing feedback and suggestions to enhance Okta's features and functionality.

## The Results

The Okta implementation delivered significant benefits for Jabil:

* **Improved Employee Satisfaction:** The simplified access experience and increased productivity led to higher employee satisfaction.
* **Reduced IT Overhead:** Centralized access management and reduced password reset requests freed up IT resources for other strategic initiatives.
* **Enhanced Security Posture:** Okta's robust security features strengthened Jabil's overall security posture, protecting sensitive data and applications.

## Conclusion

Jabil's successful Okta implementation showcases the transformative power of a centralized identity and access management solution. By embracing Okta and actively contributing to its community, Jabil demonstrated its commitment to innovation and technological excellence.
