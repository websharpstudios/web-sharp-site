## The Challenge

Home Depot, with its vast IT infrastructure, relied on legacy .NET applications for critical business operations. These applications lacked a centralized authentication and authorization system, posing security risks and hindering user experience. The challenge was to modernize access management while ensuring compatibility with existing systems.

## The Solution

We implemented a robust solution using Ping Identity and SailPoint, seamlessly integrating them with Home Depot's legacy .NET applications:

* **PingFederate for Authentication:**  We leveraged PingFederate as the central authentication platform, enabling single sign-on (SSO) for a unified user experience. This eliminated the need for users to remember multiple credentials, enhancing security and productivity.
* **SailPoint for Authorization:**  SailPoint was implemented to manage role-based access control (RBAC). This ensured that users only accessed resources relevant to their roles, strengthening security and compliance.
* **Custom .NET Integration:**  We developed custom .NET components to facilitate communication between the legacy applications, PingFederate, and SailPoint. This ensured seamless integration with minimal disruption to existing workflows.
* **User Migration and Role Mapping:**  We meticulously migrated user accounts and mapped existing roles to the new system, ensuring a smooth transition for Home Depot employees and contractors.

## The Results

The integration project delivered significant benefits:

* **Enhanced Security:**  Centralized authentication and role-based authorization significantly improved the security posture of Home Depot's legacy applications.
* **Improved User Experience:**  SSO simplified access for users, eliminating password fatigue and improving productivity.
* **Centralized Management:**  The solution provided a centralized platform for managing authentication and authorization policies, streamlining administration and reducing overhead.
* **Reduced Risk:**  By enforcing strong authentication and granular access control, the solution mitigated the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Conclusion

By integrating Ping Identity and SailPoint with Home Depot's legacy .NET applications, we successfully modernized their access management system, enhancing security, improving user experience, and reducing administrative overhead. This project exemplifies our expertise in integrating cutting-edge security solutions with complex IT environments.
