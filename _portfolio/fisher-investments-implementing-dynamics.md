### Fisher Investments - E-Sign Helps Firm Reach Milestone of 100k Clients

**Excerpt:** When systems work smoothly and reduce onboarding time, less grunt work for employees, fewer hang-ups in signing new clients. This is how you measure success.

In today's fast-paced financial services industry, operational efficiency and seamless client onboarding are paramount. Fisher Investments, a leading investment advisory firm, recently celebrated a significant milestone: surpassing 100,000 clients. This achievement was made possible through the successful integration of their document management system with their customer management system, enabling E-signature capabilities across the board. Our team played a pivotal role in this transformation, streamlining processes and enhancing client experience.

#### The Challenge

Fisher Investments faced a complex challenge: integrating multiple systems to create a cohesive, efficient workflow. The firm used Microsoft Dynamics to manage existing clients, Salesforce for prospective clients, and a separate document management system. The lack of integration between these systems resulted in redundant tasks, delayed onboarding processes, and increased workload for employees.

#### The Solution

Our team embarked on a comprehensive project to integrate Fisher Investments' document management system with their customer management systems. The goal was to enable E-signature capabilities, streamline operations, and reduce onboarding time. Hereâ€™s how we achieved this:

1. **Integration with Microsoft Dynamics:**
   - **E-Signature Enablement:** We integrated the document management system with Microsoft Dynamics, allowing for seamless E-signature capabilities. This integration enabled clients to sign documents electronically, reducing the need for physical paperwork and expediting the onboarding process.
   - **SQL Database Changes:** To support this integration, we implemented necessary changes to the SQL database. This ensured that all client data and signed documents were stored securely and could be accessed easily by the relevant teams.

2. **Custodial Bank API Integration:**
   - We integrated Custodial Bank APIs to ensure that all client transactions and account details were synchronized in real-time. This integration provided a unified view of client accounts and streamlined the management of client assets.

3. **Transition from Salesforce:**
   - **Salesforce to Microsoft Dynamics Migration:** We facilitated the transition of customer data from Salesforce to Microsoft Dynamics. This migration was crucial as it consolidated client information into a single system, making it easier to manage both prospective and existing clients.
   - **DocuSign Integration:** As part of the transition, we integrated DocuSign with Microsoft Dynamics. This integration allowed for the electronic signing of contracts and other critical documents, further enhancing the client onboarding experience.

#### The Results

The integration project delivered significant benefits to Fisher Investments:

- **Reduced Onboarding Time:** The E-signature capability drastically reduced the time required to onboard new clients. Clients could now sign documents electronically, eliminating the delays associated with physical paperwork.
- **Increased Efficiency:** The integration of the document management system with Microsoft Dynamics streamlined operations, reducing redundant tasks and freeing up employees to focus on more value-added activities.
- **Enhanced Client Experience:** Clients enjoyed a smoother, faster onboarding process, leading to higher satisfaction and retention rates.
- **Scalability:** The integrated systems provided a scalable solution that could support Fisher Investments' continued growth and expansion.

#### Conclusion

The successful integration of Fisher Investments' document management system with their customer management systems is a testament to the power of seamless technology integration. By enabling E-signature capabilities and streamlining operations, Fisher Investments was able to surpass the milestone of 100,000 clients, setting a new standard for efficiency and client satisfaction in the financial services industry.

Our team is proud to have played a role in this success story, demonstrating our commitment to delivering innovative solutions that drive results. As Fisher Investments continues to grow, we look forward to supporting their journey with cutting-edge technology and unparalleled expertise.
