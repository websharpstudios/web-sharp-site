Late summer can bring strong monsoonal storms that can make access roads hazardous or inaccessible. Fall brings cooler temperatures and marks the start of hunting season.

Perched on a plateau, the campground offers incredible views of the ocean to the north and, in good weather, of Santa Rosa to the northeast. If you are standing at campground, Cuyler Harbor Beach is a mile to the north, by trail. The ranger station is about half a mile away to the southwest. The Lester Ranch site is about halfway along that trail. To the west, in the distance, is Green Mountain. At the campground, there are nine, slatted wooden U-shaped fences or windbreaks that stand about five feet tall. A metal storage box on legs is positioned in a corner of each windbreak. A wooden and metal picnic table is adjacent to each campsite. A wooden restroom building is at the south end of the campsite. It is about 5 feet by 6 feet, with a shingled roof, a lockable door, and a single pit toilet inside. The sign on the door shows symbols for a man and a woman. On the exterior, attached to one side, is a low box with a hinged lid. On another side of the building is a bulletin board with updateable information posted behind glass. On the fourth side of the building is a panel of regulations titled ‚ÄúSan Miguel Island Campground‚Äù with its own, separate audio description."

,"audioDescription":"You are standing in the campground, near the wide mouth of a canyon. The campground is in a field of grass, nestled between two hills dotted with scrubby shrubs. At the southern edge of the campground is a creek that runs at the base of the canyon. A distant view of the ocean can be seen beyond the mouth of the canyon. At the lowest part of the campground, if you are facing up-canyon, the restroom building is on your right. A short cement sidewalk leads up toward this single-story wooden building with a gabled, or simple peaked, roof. The roof has two solar panels on the roof. One is a solar hot water panel‚Äîa grey metal box, about one foot high, with two pipes attached, one with a spigot. The other is a photovoltaic panel, only about 2 inches high. The building has reddish brown, horizontal, wood plank siding. A shallow porch, with railings, wraps around two sides of the building, covered by a roof overhand, supported by posts and beams. You can access the porch two ways. On the building‚Äôs left side is a handicapped accessible ramp. The front side of the building has stairs with railings and five risers. On the ground next to the stairs is a metal box with two thick brushes that face inward. On the front side, the porch has a bulletin board on the wall, flanked by doors for two unisex restrooms. On the side of the porch is a large deep sink, with an adjacent wide wooden counter with a backboard, that overhangs and slants down toward the sink. From the restroom location, you can see fifteen shelters‚Äîthree-sided wooden structures with grey shingled roofs. Each structure is shaped like a hexagon that has been cut in half, open on the side that faces the ocean. Each wall surface of the exterior of these shelters has a solid sheet of tan-colored siding. The interior walls are unfinished open frame construction. Mounted to one interior side wall is a metal box, about one foot high by two feet wide by one foot deep. Metal pegs and hooks on the walls are used to hang clothing and gear. A translucent fiberglass panel at the top of the back wall provides some natural light. Each shelter site has a picnic table located in or near the shelter. Tents are pitched in or near the shelters as well. The shelter sites are about 40 feet apart from each other. At the edge of the campground, on the downhill side, is a water station. This is a two and a half foot tall wooden post, with a pipe running up it to a faucet on top. Surrounding it on the ground is a wooden frame filled with rocks. The post has a water faucet, a small metal box screwed into its side. A wooden plaque with a sign that reads, Please help protect our wildlife. Please do not rinse dishes, brush teeth, or use soap at the water faucets. Please wash dishes at the large sink next to bathroom. Thank you."
