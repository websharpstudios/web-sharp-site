title: "Taylor"
excerpt: "Taylor was one of my two cats. A loan company committed grand larceny and sold my house without my knowledge, so I was surprised with an eviction in April. I continued bringing him tuna and water until I had to leave to Texas. Having nowhere to stay I slept in my truck with them for a few nights while, but when I came back from Texas I haven't seen either of them. If you see Samantha or Taylor, my best friends, please give them food and water, they are the most super friendly cats I ever met. They were raised indoors and very friendly. They might not be able to find enough food and water outdoors right now. If you see them please let me know and leave them some water and food.  They have been missing for about two months now"

 Taylor was one of my two cats. A fake loan company run by McCarthy Holthus law firm sold my house without my knowledge, and surprised me with an eviction in April. I couldnt take taylor with me to texas, but I continued bringing him tuna and water until I had to leave.  I slept in my truck with them for a few nights before I left, but when I came back from Texas I haven't seen either of them. If you see Samantha or Taylor, my best friends, please give them food and water, they are the very loving cats. They were raised indoors and might not be able to find enough food and water outdoors right now. If you see them please let me know and leave them some water and food. I miss them dearly they were my best friends. What some people will do for the love of money is just sick. I'm absolutely heartbroken.
