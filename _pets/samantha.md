title: "Samantha"
excerpt: "Samantha is such a sweetheart and one of the most loving cats I ever met.  She would always sleep indoors after she had 8 kittens when she was young. She is spayed now and very friendly. Her tail is a little crookid at the end. She was always an indoor cat. recently we were evicted from our house after a greedy law firm and criminal organization called BSI committed title fraud. I brought them food and water for a couple of weeks. We were told by the Sherrif that we would be allowed to collect our belongings but they never let us back in. I lost all of my clothes and family heirlooms and since I returned from Texas I havent been able to find them. If you this cat please give her water and food. Her and her brother have been missing for two months and I would love to know if you see either one of them"

Her and her brother have been missing for two months and I would love to see them again and miss them very much.  I'm heartbroken over this, and want the entire world to know that BSI and McCarthy Holthus do this to people for thier love of money.
