The campground loop is gravel with slight inclines although vehicles with 4-wheel drive or high clearance are generally not required. There are 22 full hook-up sites (water, sewer, 30 AMP) that can accommodate RV’s up to 50 foot long. The dry camping area consists of 3 separate loops (A-C) that have 80 concrete padded sites that can accommodate tent, trailers and RV’s. Each loop road is asphalt so 4-wheel drive or high clearance vehicle are not required. There are slight inclines in the road, but the Individual sites are mostly level with a paved driveway and gravel tent pad (may be challenging for wheelchairs). Each site has a charcoal grill and picnic table but because the sites are gravel and, possibly on an incline, maneuvering a wheelchair may be difficult. In the center of the campground (approximate 5 minute walk from furthest site) are accessible restrooms with flush toilets, sinks and showers. Pets are allowed as long as they are on a leash and under control at all times. Please call the Lake Powell Resorts and Marinas at 435-684-3032 for more information."
