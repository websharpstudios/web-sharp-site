Turn right at the first road immediately after the Bullfrog Visitor Center parking lot and travel ½ mile to reach the entrance to the RV park on the west side of the road. The campground loop is gravel with slight inclines although vehicles with 4-wheel drive or high clearance are generally not required. There are 22 full hook-up sites (water, sewer, 30 AMP) that can accommodate RV’s up to 50 foot long. The dry camping area consists of 3 separate loops (A-C) that have 80 concrete padded sites that can accommodate tent, trailers and RV’s. Each loop road is asphalt so 4-wheel drive or high clearance vehicle are not required. There are slight inclines in the road, but the Individual sites are mostly level with a paved driveway and gravel tent pad (may be challenging for wheelchairs). Each site has a charcoal grill and picnic table but because the sites are gravel and, possibly on an incline, maneuvering a wheelchair may be difficult. In the center of the campground (approximate 5 minute walk from furthest site) are accessible restrooms with flush toilets, sinks and showers. Pets are allowed as long as they are on a leash and under control at all times. Please call the Lake Powell Resorts and Marinas at 435-684-3032 for more information.",

To the left (north) is the entrance to the Campground reservation station parking lot. To the right begins the one-way loop into and around the campground itself. Turning left into the Campground reservation lot, two long rows of parallel parking spaces face left and right along a one-lane, roughly 250-foot (75 meter) long central driveway. The cinderblock Campground reservation station is located at the top of the lot at the right. A concrete sidewalk surrounds the station, edged with low, flat boulders. Note a wheelchair-accessible parking space located at the top of the lot at the right, just before the station. A short, concrete ramp leads up from the space to the station sidewalk. At the top of the ramp to the right, note an automated external defibrillator (AED) device mounted in a small metal and glass case on the side wall of the building. Note there is a second wheelchair-accessible, reserved parking area directly across the road from the station at the left. The reservation window juts out from the left-side wall of the small building, with a thick, 12-inch (30 centimeter) deep wooden writing shelf along its entire width at its base (about four feet [one point two meters] high). Note two concrete support pillars set back from the window on the sidewalk at the front left and right. Bulletin boards on the walls on both sides of the wide, central reservation window provide information about weather in the canyon, North Rim Park Ranger programs, and other camping available outside the park. The North Rim Campground has three A D A accessible family campsites. These sites have larger parking areas, are located closer to restrooms, and have raised fire rings. From the three A D A campsites, wheelchairs can access the nearby restrooms. Restrooms have paved ramps to restroom entrances, and each restroom has an A D A compliant stall. Moving from the General Store into the Campground, note a small dirt and gravel area at the left with an information kiosk in the center under some trees. Being mindful of a couple boulders in front of the kiosk, a couple bulletin boards provide information about the weather, North Rim Park Ranger programs, and what’s currently in bloom. In the Spring and early Summer, bitterweed blooms with long, thin yellow petals, alongside the small yellow clusters of creeping barberry, the deep blue to bluish purple, notched flowers of Nelson’s larkspur, the elongated clusters of purple lupine, or the rounded pink and white petals of spreading phlox. Later in the season, the yellow desert blazing star blooms with five broad, bright yellow petals with a tuft of yellow filaments in the center, alongside goldenrod, pink and white buckbrush, wild strawberry, and the showy red tubular, two-inch long, three-lobed blooms of the long leafed paintbrush.
